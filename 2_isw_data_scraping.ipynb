      "<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces are concentrating in the eastern, northwestern, and western outskirts of Kyiv for an assault on the capital in the coming 24-96 hours. The Russians are bringing up supplies and reinforcements as well as conducting artillery, air, and missile attacks to weaken defenses and intimidate defenders in advance of such an assault.</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> It is too soon to gauge the likely effectiveness of any Russian attempt to complete the encirclement of Kyiv or to seize the city at this time. If Russian troops have been able to resupply, reorganize, and plan deliberate and coordinated simultaneous operations along the several axes of advance around and into the capital, they may be more successful in this operation than they have in previous undertakings. Operations near Kyiv in the past 72 hours have not offered enough evidence to evaluate that likelihood.</span></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian troops in southern Ukraine continue to divide their efforts between attacks westward toward Mykolayiv and Odesa, attacks northward toward Zaporizhya, and attacks eastward toward Mariupol and Donbas. Failure to focus on any single line of advance has likely hindered Russian operations and will probably continue to do so. Russian troops in Kherson Oblast appear to be feeling their way around Mykolayiv, likely seeking to find a route across the Southern Bug River that would allow them to bypass Mykolayiv itself and resume their advance on Odesa. Those heading toward Zaporizhya currently lack the combat power likely necessary to encircle or take that large city. They could, however, set conditions for successful operations against Zaporizhya once reinforcements arrive following the fall of Mariupol and the opening of a wide land route westward from Donbas.</span></p>\n",

      "<li><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances westward.</span></li>\n",
      "</ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis consist of a main effort aimed at encircling the city from the northwest, west, east.</strong></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces are likely completing preparations for an assault to seize Kyiv from the east and west within the next 24-96 hours. The Russians are setting conditions for the attack by concentrating supplies and reinforcements, attempting to advance and stabilize their lines, and attacking the city with air, artillery, and missile fire likely intended both to demoralize and to damage Kyiv’s defenders. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 6 that the Russians have started accumulating the resources they would need to storm the capital.</span><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">[1]</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> The General Staff noted that Ukrainian forces retain a coherent defense of the city at this time.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[2]</span></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">        </span></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Russian forces have continued their efforts to secure control of the town of Irpin, approximately 20 kilometers west-northwest of the center of Kyiv, as well as the town of Bucha, about 4 kilometers north of Irpin, in the last 24 hours.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[3]</span> The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 6 that Russian tank and motorized infantry columns are operating in the Irpin area.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[4]</span> Social media reports and reports from the ground support this assessment.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[5]</span> The Russians are reportedly using a siege-and-starve approach in Irpin similar to activities they conducted in Syria in order to compel Irpin to surrender. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 7 that the Russians have denied the inhabitants of Irpin water, heating, and food supplies for three days and are not allowing them to leave.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[6]</span> Social media users reported damage from Russian rocket attacks on civilian infrastructure in Irpin on March 7.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[7]</span> The Ukrainian General Staff also reported that Russian elements under the command of Chechen leader Ramazan Kadyrov were shelling civilian targets on March 7 in the town of Myla, roughly 7.5 kilometers southwest of Irpin.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[8]</span> These reports are all consistent with previously-observed Russian efforts to consolidate control of this critical area to facilitate further advances south and southeast to encircle Kyiv and/or to launch attacks directly against central Kyiv itself. Continued Russian fighting and shelling in this area in the last 24 hours could indicate that conditions are not yet set on the northwestern axis for Russian forces to launch the ground attack directly against Kyiv within the next 24 hours, but ISW does not have sufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that they might do so.</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Subordinate supporting effort — Chernihiv axis</strong></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 7 that Russian forces are concentrating elements of the 41st Combined Arms Army near the southern outskirts of Chernihiv and intend to encircle and presumably seize the town.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[9]</span> It had previously reported its assessment that Russian troops intend to seize Chernihiv city on March 6.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[10]</span> Social media reports from March 6 of Russian weapons systems near Chernihiv may support this assessment.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[11]</span> Major Russian combat operations against Chernihiv city have not been reported as of this publication.</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Subordinate supporting effort — Sumy axis</strong></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Russian troops are establishing themselves in Kyiv’s eastern outskirts as of March 7. The Ukrainian General Staff reported a successful March 6 attack against a Russian weapons depot in Nova Basan, roughly 70 kilometers east-northeast of Kyiv’s center.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[12]</span> That depot was likely supporting Russian operations reported in our previous updates on the axis from Brovary toward Boryspil airport. Social media reports of Russian multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) units firing on Kyiv from the vicinity of Peremoha, near Brovary and about 23 kilometers from central Kyiv, support assessments that Russian troops are conducting fire attacks to set conditions for further ground operations in the eastern Kyiv outskirts.</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">ISW has previously assessed that Russian forces in and around Brovary likely came from the Sumy axis and continue to be supported along the roads stretching east through Sumy to Russia. The Russians face challenges sustaining such a long logistics line, particularly since they have not yet captured Sumy itself and Ukrainian forces continue to conduct attacks along the route. The Ukrainian General Staff assessed on March 6 that Russian forces are focused on encircling Sumy (and other cities).</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[13]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> It reported on March 7 that Russian troops are preparing to attack Sumy.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[14]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> It noted on March 7 that Russian forces near Okhtyrka, about 68 kilometers south of Sumy and 100 kilometers west-northwest of Kharkiv, had taken 50 percent losses and had to regroup and resupply.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[15]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> The Ukrainian General Staff offered the same assessment of Russian forces in Konotop, roughly 120 kilometers west-northwest of Sumy. The Ukrainian General Staff also reported a March 6 attack on a Russian weapons depot near Skrypali, about 81 kilometers west of Sumy along the road via Priluky and Brovary to Kyiv.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[16]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> These continued Ukrainian attacks against Russian logistical positions along this extended line of advance may delay or disrupt Russian efforts to launch a ground offensive against Kyiv itself from the east.</span></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The Russians have reportedly not yet secured the entire stretch of a critical road along this axis, moreover, as social media reports indicate that Ukrainian forces still control the important town of Romny and Ukrainian media notes that the town of Lebedyn is also still under Ukrainian control.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[17]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> The Russians may feel it necessary to finish securing their ground lines of communication to eastern Kyiv before attempting to take the capital. If they do not do so, they risk disruptions and challenges during the climactic battle of the campaign.</span></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv:</strong></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces have continued to attack Kharkiv by air and ground fires but have not renewed a ground offensive attack on the city. The Ukrainian General Staff assesses that the Russians will attempt to encircle Kharkiv, but ISW has observed no indicators of imminent Russian operations along those lines. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Numerous social media reports from March 6 and 7 show the effects of Russian bombardments in and around Kharkiv, indicating that Russian attacks are indiscriminate.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[18]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> Ukrainian forces continue to report on losses they have inflicted on Russian troops, especially senior officers killed in the fighting.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[19]</span></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Supporting Effort #1a—Luhansk Oblast:</strong></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Social media reports indicate that Ukrainian forces conducted a counterattack on March 6 against Russian forces operating near Severodonetsk, as well as on an explosion and fire at an oil depot in Luhansk.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[20]</span> Russian forces do not appear to have made significant gains on this axis in the past 24 hours.</p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol:</strong></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Russian forces continued their encirclement of Mariupol and have increased efforts to break into the city as well as to drive on Volnovakha, roughly 56 kilometers north of Mariupol, from the east and the west. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on indecisive fighting roughly 50 kilometers west of Volnovakha around Lubymivka, which the Russians reportedly hold.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[21]</span> The Ukrainian General Staff report suggests that Russian efforts to reach Volnovakha from the east are having more success, although they have not yet succeeded.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[22]</span> Russian troops also attempted to enter the neighborhood of Staryi Krim, northwest of Mariupol, on March 7, but were repulsed according to the Ukrainian General Staff. Social media posts testify to the intensity of combat in and around Mariupol.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[23]</span></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and west:</strong></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Russian forces operating north of Crimea appear to continue to divide their efforts into penny-packets along multiple axes of advance. The Ukrainian General Staff reports that of the 17 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) operating in the vicinity of Kherson two are focused on Mykolayiv, two are driving up the Southern Bug toward Vosnesensk, one is allocated to an advance on Odesa at some point (but has not likely begun that advance), four are operating northward toward Zaporizhya, and three are supporting the Mariupol effort.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[24]</span> Social media reports showed Russian armored vehicles moving through Heniches’k, likely toward either Mariupol or Melitopol, on March 6.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[25]</span> Roughly 49 Russian helicopters were spotted at Kherson Airbase on March 6.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[26]</span></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces appear to be prioritizing operations north from Crimea toward Zaporizhya City itself. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 7 that Russian troops are restoring the airfield at Melitopol, roughly 110 kilometers south of Zaporizhya.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[27]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> Its previous report had identified three Russian BTGs advancing north toward Zaporizhya.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[28]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> Zaporizhya is a large city of nearly three-quarters of a million people. Russian troops are unlikely to be able to encircle or seize it with an attack on this scale if Ukrainians defend it as they have defended other threatened cities.</span></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian troops are conducting intense shelling of Mykolayiv and nearby towns, likely to prepare for a ground assault on the city.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[29]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> The Ukrainian General Staff reported that a Russian BTG crossed the Inhul River at Kashpero-Mykolaivka, roughly 50 kilometers north of Mykolayiv, on March 6.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[30]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> This movement is consistent with expected Russian efforts to reach crossings of the Southern Bug north of Mykolayiv, as a fight to seize Mykolayiv and its bridge would likely delay the prepared Russian attack on Odesa for longer than the Russian General Staff would prefer.</span></p>\n",
      "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Immediate items to watch</strong></p>\n",
      "<ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>Russian forces may launch an attempt to encircle Kyiv from east and west and/or to seize the city center itself within the next 24-96 hours;</li>\n",

       "<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces are concentrating in the eastern, northwestern, and western outskirts of Kyiv for an assault on the capital in the coming 24-96 hours. The Russians are bringing up supplies and reinforcements as well as conducting artillery, air, and missile attacks to weaken defenses and intimidate defenders in advance of such an assault.</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> It is too soon to gauge the likely effectiveness of any Russian attempt to complete the encirclement of Kyiv or to seize the city at this time. If Russian troops have been able to resupply, reorganize, and plan deliberate and coordinated simultaneous operations along the several axes of advance around and into the capital, they may be more successful in this operation than they have in previous undertakings. Operations near Kyiv in the past 72 hours have not offered enough evidence to evaluate that likelihood.</span></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian troops in southern Ukraine continue to divide their efforts between attacks westward toward Mykolayiv and Odesa, attacks northward toward Zaporizhya, and attacks eastward toward Mariupol and Donbas. Failure to focus on any single line of advance has likely hindered Russian operations and will probably continue to do so. Russian troops in Kherson Oblast appear to be feeling their way around Mykolayiv, likely seeking to find a route across the Southern Bug River that would allow them to bypass Mykolayiv itself and resume their advance on Odesa. Those heading toward Zaporizhya currently lack the combat power likely necessary to encircle or take that large city. They could, however, set conditions for successful operations against Zaporizhya once reinforcements arrive following the fall of Mariupol and the opening of a wide land route westward from Donbas.</span></p>\n",

       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:</strong></p>\n",

       "<li>Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv;\n",

       "<li><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Supporting effort 2—Mariupol; and</span></li>\n",
       "<li><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances westward.</span></li>\n",
       "</ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis consist of a main effort aimed at encircling the city from the northwest, west, east.</strong></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces are likely completing preparations for an assault to seize Kyiv from the east and west within the next 24-96 hours. The Russians are setting conditions for the attack by concentrating supplies and reinforcements, attempting to advance and stabilize their lines, and attacking the city with air, artillery, and missile fire likely intended both to demoralize and to damage Kyiv’s defenders. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 6 that the Russians have started accumulating the resources they would need to storm the capital.</span><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">[1]</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> The General Staff noted that Ukrainian forces retain a coherent defense of the city at this time.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[2]</span></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">        </span></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Russian forces have continued their efforts to secure control of the town of Irpin, approximately 20 kilometers west-northwest of the center of Kyiv, as well as the town of Bucha, about 4 kilometers north of Irpin, in the last 24 hours.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[3]</span> The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 6 that Russian tank and motorized infantry columns are operating in the Irpin area.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[4]</span> Social media reports and reports from the ground support this assessment.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[5]</span> The Russians are reportedly using a siege-and-starve approach in Irpin similar to activities they conducted in Syria in order to compel Irpin to surrender. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 7 that the Russians have denied the inhabitants of Irpin water, heating, and food supplies for three days and are not allowing them to leave.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[6]</span> Social media users reported damage from Russian rocket attacks on civilian infrastructure in Irpin on March 7.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[7]</span> The Ukrainian General Staff also reported that Russian elements under the command of Chechen leader Ramazan Kadyrov were shelling civilian targets on March 7 in the town of Myla, roughly 7.5 kilometers southwest of Irpin.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[8]</span> These reports are all consistent with previously-observed Russian efforts to consolidate control of this critical area to facilitate further advances south and southeast to encircle Kyiv and/or to launch attacks directly against central Kyiv itself. Continued Russian fighting and shelling in this area in the last 24 hours could indicate that conditions are not yet set on the northwestern axis for Russian forces to launch the ground attack directly against Kyiv within the next 24 hours, but ISW does not have sufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that they might do so.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Subordinate supporting effort — Chernihiv axis</strong></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 7 that Russian forces are concentrating elements of the 41st Combined Arms Army near the southern outskirts of Chernihiv and intend to encircle and presumably seize the town.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[9]</span> It had previously reported its assessment that Russian troops intend to seize Chernihiv city on March 6.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[10]</span> Social media reports from March 6 of Russian weapons systems near Chernihiv may support this assessment.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[11]</span> Major Russian combat operations against Chernihiv city have not been reported as of this publication.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Subordinate supporting effort — Sumy axis</strong></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Russian troops are establishing themselves in Kyiv’s eastern outskirts as of March 7. The Ukrainian General Staff reported a successful March 6 attack against a Russian weapons depot in Nova Basan, roughly 70 kilometers east-northeast of Kyiv’s center.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[12]</span> That depot was likely supporting Russian operations reported in our previous updates on the axis from Brovary toward Boryspil airport. Social media reports of Russian multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) units firing on Kyiv from the vicinity of Peremoha, near Brovary and about 23 kilometers from central Kyiv, support assessments that Russian troops are conducting fire attacks to set conditions for further ground operations in the eastern Kyiv outskirts.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">ISW has previously assessed that Russian forces in and around Brovary likely came from the Sumy axis and continue to be supported along the roads stretching east through Sumy to Russia. The Russians face challenges sustaining such a long logistics line, particularly since they have not yet captured Sumy itself and Ukrainian forces continue to conduct attacks along the route. The Ukrainian General Staff assessed on March 6 that Russian forces are focused on encircling Sumy (and other cities).</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[13]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> It reported on March 7 that Russian troops are preparing to attack Sumy.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[14]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> It noted on March 7 that Russian forces near Okhtyrka, about 68 kilometers south of Sumy and 100 kilometers west-northwest of Kharkiv, had taken 50 percent losses and had to regroup and resupply.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[15]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> The Ukrainian General Staff offered the same assessment of Russian forces in Konotop, roughly 120 kilometers west-northwest of Sumy. The Ukrainian General Staff also reported a March 6 attack on a Russian weapons depot near Skrypali, about 81 kilometers west of Sumy along the road via Priluky and Brovary to Kyiv.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[16]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> These continued Ukrainian attacks against Russian logistical positions along this extended line of advance may delay or disrupt Russian efforts to launch a ground offensive against Kyiv itself from the east.</span></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The Russians have reportedly not yet secured the entire stretch of a critical road along this axis, moreover, as social media reports indicate that Ukrainian forces still control the important town of Romny and Ukrainian media notes that the town of Lebedyn is also still under Ukrainian control.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[17]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> The Russians may feel it necessary to finish securing their ground lines of communication to eastern Kyiv before attempting to take the capital. If they do not do so, they risk disruptions and challenges during the climactic battle of the campaign.</span></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv:</strong></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces have continued to attack Kharkiv by air and ground fires but have not renewed a ground offensive attack on the city. The Ukrainian General Staff assesses that the Russians will attempt to encircle Kharkiv, but ISW has observed no indicators of imminent Russian operations along those lines. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Numerous social media reports from March 6 and 7 show the effects of Russian bombardments in and around Kharkiv, indicating that Russian attacks are indiscriminate.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[18]</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\"> Ukrainian forces continue to report on losses they have inflicted on Russian troops, especially senior officers killed in the fighting.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[19]</span></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Supporting Effort #1a—Luhansk Oblast:</strong></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Social media reports indicate that Ukrainian forces conducted a counterattack on March 6 against Russian forces operating near Severodonetsk, as well as on an explosion and fire at an oil depot in Luhansk.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[20]</span> Russian forces do not appear to have made significant gains on this axis in the past 24 hours.</p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol:</strong></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Russian forces continued their encirclement of Mariupol and have increased efforts to break into the city as well as to drive on Volnovakha, roughly 56 kilometers north of Mariupol, from the east and the west. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on indecisive fighting roughly 50 kilometers west of Volnovakha around Lubymivka, which the Russians reportedly hold.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[21]</span> The Ukrainian General Staff report suggests that Russian efforts to reach Volnovakha from the east are having more success, although they have not yet succeeded.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[22]</span> Russian troops also attempted to enter the neighborhood of Staryi Krim, northwest of Mariupol, on March 7, but were repulsed according to the Ukrainian General Staff. Social media posts testify to the intensity of combat in and around Mariupol.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[23]</span></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and west:</strong></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Russian forces operating north of Crimea appear to continue to divide their efforts into penny-packets along multiple axes of advance. The Ukrainian General Staff reports that of the 17 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) operating in the vicinity of Kherson two are focused on Mykolayiv, two are driving up the Southern Bug toward Vosnesensk, one is allocated to an advance on Odesa at some point (but has not likely begun that advance), four are operating northward toward Zaporizhya, and three are supporting the Mariupol effort.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[24]</span> Social media reports showed Russian armored vehicles moving through Heniches’k, likely toward either Mariupol or Melitopol, on March 6.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[25]</span> Roughly 49 Russian helicopters were spotted at Kherson Airbase on March 6.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">[26]</span></p>\n",
       "<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Russian forces appear to be prioritizing operations north from Crimea toward Zaporizhya City itself.

       "'\\nRussian forces entered the outskirts of Kyiv on the west bank of the Dnipro on February 25. Russian sabotage groups in civilian clothes are reportedly active in downtown Kyiv.\\nRussian forces have so far failed to enter Kyiv’s eastern outskirts. Ukrainian forces have successfully slowed Russian troops, which have temporarily abandoned the failed attempt to take the city of Chernihiv and are instead bypassing it.\\nElements of the Russian 76th VDV (Airborne) division have concentrated in southeastern Belarus likely for use along the Chernihiv-bypass axis toward Kyiv in the next 24 hours.\\nRussian forces will likely envelop Kharkhiv in the next 24 hours after failing to enter the city through frontal assaults on February 24.\\nRussian forces have achieved little success on frontal assaults or envelopments against Ukrainian forces in Donbas but may not have intended to do more than pin Ukrainian forces in the east.\\nNorth of Crimea, Russian forces fully captured Kherson and are likely on the verge of seizing Melitopol in the east. Unconfirmed reports indicate that Russian forces had bypassed Kherson earlier and headed directly for Mykolaiv and Odessa.\\nRussian forces may be assembling in Stolin, Belarus, to open a new line of advance against Rivne in western Ukraine.\\n\\nClick here to enlarge the map below.\\n\\n\\n\\nRussian forces carried out additional air and missile strikes on Kyiv and other major cities around 3:00 am local time on February 25.ISW cannot confirm the frequency and targets of overnight Russian strikes at this time. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces are increasingly targeting civil infrastructure and residential buildings “to intimidate the population of Ukraine.”[3]Russian forces continue to refrain from using the likely full scale of Russian air and missile capabilities, likely seeking to limit the negative imagery of heavy Ukrainian civilian casualties. However, Russian forces will likely increase their use of bombardments in coming days to overcome heavier-than-anticipated Ukrainian resistance.\\nRussian ground forces are advancing on four primary axes, discussed in turn below:\\nBelarus/Kyiv;\\nKharkiv;\\nDonbas; and\\nCrimea-Kherson.\\n1)Belarus/Kyiv axis: Russian forces entered the outskirts of Kyiv on the west bank of the Dnipro on February 25. Russian forces have so far failed to enter Kyiv’s eastern outskirts. They have abandoned for now the failed attempt to take the city of Chernihiv and are instead bypassing it. Elements of the 76thVDV (Airborne) division have concentrated in southeastern Belarus likely for use along the Chernihiv-bypass axis toward Kyiv in the next 24 hours.\\nRussian forces entered the northwest Kyiv suburb of Obolon, on the western bank of the Dnipro River, as of 11:00 am local time.[4]The Ukrainian General Staff asked residents of Obolon to shelter in place and make Molotov cocktails the morning of February 25.[5]The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed at 3:30 pm local time on February 25 that Russian forces had isolated Kyiv from the west.[6]\\nRussian forces bypassed the city of Chernihiv on the eastern approach to Kyiv after being halted by Ukrainian forces much of February 24-25.[7]The UK Defense Ministry reported at 6:00 pm local time that Russian forces opened a “new route” to Kyiv after failing to capture Chernihiv.[8]Russian forces have not yet entered Kyiv’s eastern outskirts.\\nThe Ukrainian general staff reported Russian VDV (airborne) troops redeployed from Belarus to theeastbank of the Dnipro River due to damage to the Hostomel military airport on the western bank, now in Russian hands after Ukrainian forces withdrew sometime early on February 25.[9]Russian forces failed to secure Hostomel airport by air assault and appear to have taken it only when mechanized units from Belarus arrived. Ukrainian defenders appear to have damaged the runway enough to make it unusable, preventing Russian forces from airlifting troops directly onto Kyiv’s western flank and causing Russian forces to reprioritize the eastern axis of advance.\\nRussian reconnaissance and sabotage units, many reportedly operating in civilian clothes or captured Ukrainian uniforms, are reportedly active in central Kyiv. A Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister reported Russian forces seized two Ukrainian trucks to break through Ukrainian lines into central Kyiv around noon local time.[10]The Ukrainian General Staff warned at 5:00 pm local time that Russian units in civilian clothes are operating in several unspecified Ukrainian cities.[11]\\nPresident Zelensky, his Chief of Staff, and Prime Minister Shmyhal released a video from downtown Kyiv at 8:00 pm local time on February 25 stating “we are all here, defending our independence.”[12]\\nThe Ukrainian military reported it redeployed unspecified units to assist in the defense of Kyiv.[13]ISW cannot currently confirm the extent of Ukrainian preparations to conduct urban fighting in Kyiv.\\n2)Kharkiv axis: Russian forces will likely envelop Kharkiv in the next 24 hours after failing to enter the city through frontal assaults on February 24. Russian forces are now advancing on a broad front along the northeastern Ukrainian border as of February 25.\\nKharkiv civil authorities reported Russian forces entering the outskirts of Kharkiv from several directions at 9:00 pm local time.[14]Elements of Russia’s 25th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, part of the 6th Combined Arms Army and permanently deployed near St Petersburg, are confirmed to be active in Kharkiv.[15]\\nRussian forces have reportedly crossed the northeastern Ukrainian border at several other points both west of Kharkiv, including Okhtyrka and Sumy.[16]Russian forces are likely advancing toward Kyiv on a broad front and may seek to envelop and isolate Kharkiv.\\n3)Donbas axis: Russian forces have achieved little success on the frontal assaults or the envelopment but may not have intended to do more than pin Ukrainian forces in the east. The Russians have not weighted their ground offensive efforts toward breaking through Ukrainian defensive positions on the line of contact, taking Mariupol from the east, or driving rapidly through Luhansk Oblast to the north. Ukrainian forces remain largely in their original defensive positions in the east. The Russians may be content to leave them there while concentrating on capturing Kyiv and imposing a new government on Ukraine. They may alternatively seek to envelop and destroy Ukrainian forces at and near the line of contact at a later date.\\nRussian forces have been unable to continue an enveloping maneuver through Donetsk Oblast as of 4:00 pm local time February 25.[17]They have not apparently reinforced their efforts to do so, however, suggesting that they may not be very determined to make rapid progress on this axis as long as Ukrainian forces remain in defensive positions. Ukrainian forces report undergoing continuous shelling.\\nUkrainian forces claim to continue to hold the entire line of contact in Donetsk and Luhansk as of 1pm local time February 25.[18]\\nRussian forces are likely conducting a frontal assault on Mariupol from the northeast. The mayor of Mariupol claimed Ukrainian forces destroyed twenty-two Russian tanks advancing from Pavlopil at 4:00 pm local time on February 25.[19]Russian sources reported shelling Mariupol with MLRS systems at 7:00 pm local time on February 25.[20]\\n4)Crimea axis: Russian forces fully captured Kherson and are likely on the verge of seizing Melitopol in the east. Unconfirmed reports indicate that Russian forces had bypassed Kherson earlier and headed directly for Mykolaiv and Odessa.\\nRussian forces reportedly captured Kherson at 6:00 pm local time on February 25.[21]Elements of the Russian 42nd Motor Rifle Division of the 58th Combined Arms Army and unknown VDV (Airborne) elements are confirmed to be active in Kherson.[22]\\nRussian forces are advancing west of Kherson and reportedly bypassed it early February 25 before its capture by follow-on Russian forces later in the day. Ukrainian forces destroyed at least one bridge over the Dnipro to slow Russian forces.[23]The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense reported Russian forces are advancing on Mykolaiv.[24]ISW cannot confirm the current depth of Russian advances.\\nRussian forces may have captured Melitopol, east of Crimea, late on February 25. Ukrainian forces reported defending the city at 10:00 am local time February 25.[25]Russian forces claimed to have captured the city as of 6:00 pm local time.[26]\\nThe Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russia is deploying second echelon troops to Kherson on February 25. If confirmed, this is the first Russian deployment of second-line troops into Ukrainian territory.[27]\\nISW cannot confirm any Russian amphibious landings as of 3:00 pm EST. Several Western sources misreported a quote from an anonymous US official that there are indications of Russia’s capability to conduct an amphibious assault west of Mariupol with thousands of troops as meaning a landing had already occurred.[28]Russia may wait until forces from Crimea have fully secured crossings over the Dnipro River or gotten closer to Odesa before attempting to seize Odesa by air and sea.\\nImmediate items to watch\\nSocial media users observed a Russian armored column assembling in Stolin, Belarus, on February 25.[29]These forces could potentially conduct a new line of advance against Rivne in western Ukraine.\\nRussian Naval Infantry have not yet conducted amphibious landings but retain the capability to do so against the Odesa or the Azov Sea coasts or both.\\nRussian forces continue to refrain from using their likely full spectrum of air and missile capabilities. The Ukrainian air force also remains active. Russian operations will likely steadily wear down Ukrainian air capabilities and eventually take the Ukrainian air force out of the fight.\\nRussian forces have not yet attempted the decapitation strike several analysts and outlets have forecasted and may attempt to do so in the near future.\\nRussia has sufficient conventional military power to reinforce each of its current axes of advance and overpower the conventional Ukrainian forces defending them.\\n\\n'"
